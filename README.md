# VCDIFF implementation in c#

Implementation is based on existing works :

* [miscellaneous utility library by jon skeet](http://jonskeet.uk/csharp/miscutil/)
* [delta.cs in LVK.Open library](http://sourceforge.net/projects/lvkopen/)

This library targets the following goals :

* strictly no dependencies on any tier library
* to be as most portable as possible (think dot net core)
